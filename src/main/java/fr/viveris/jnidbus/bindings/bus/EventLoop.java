/**
 * The event loop is the core of the library, it will be responsible for sending, receiving and waiting for events. The whole object is thread safe and communication
 * between this class and other threads is done using Queues. This allows us to easily implement a safe E.L without having to deal with low level and error prone
 * wait/notify mechanism.
 *
 * We have to proceed like this as the event loop must not be waiting for event when writing because Dbus might want to listen for write events in order to send
 * efficiently. In addition there is some synchronization around the wakeup call, which will unblock the tick() call, this synchronization is made in order to
 * avoid extra calls to wakeup() which could cause the loop to spin faster than it needs to.
 *
 * Any call made to the event loop while it has not started will block until the event loop started or failed to start. This class is also responsible for closing
 * the underlying DBus connection as we want to make sure all the pending events are processed before closing.
